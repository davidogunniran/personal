                    Hi... so basically, if you reached this point, you are here to see <br> what I'm really about. That's okay and I'll tell you a few. Grab a seat!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>
                                Photography
                            </strong> <p> I'm a fan of pretty stuff(photography). From animals to natural imagery up to even abstract, I'm a die hard fan. Once I see one, I save, if I can't, I screenshot. Of course, I'm not a professional photographer, so you know why I'm not talking about the technical stuff.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Reader</strong> <p>books... books... books. You know what they say... <em>Readers are leaders</em>. <br> Every one gets to lead at one point or the other in their lives. Seeing that I want to lead well when it gets to my turn , then I've got to read books,. From the Holy Bible, motivational books, up to relationship manuals... I read them all. Not to forget super engaging Articles on Medium and Quora spanning across various spheres of life.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Traveller</strong> <p>
                                Yeah, I've only had few opportunties to travel around the world but I want to see more. I love exploring various cultures, traditions, tastes and foods.
                                The world is super diverse and exploring is one sure way of meeting individuals with interesting thought patterns.
